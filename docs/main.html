	<h3>Getting Started </h3><img style="float:right; width:25%" src="resource/shell.jpg">
	<p>The first thing you need to do to get started with smash scripting, is check your system for
		compatibility with smash and the smash build system.
		In general if you can meet two-basic-requirments, your system is compatible with the smash software:
		<ul>
				<li>Linux C library version 6.0 compatible Operating System, Module, Library or Emulation</li>
				<li>Mozilla NSPR (v4+) Library (Many systems have this with Firefox)</li>
			</ul>
			System compatibility is one thing, system configuration is another. Expert-system-knowledge may be required of you
			to complete a smash installation on an unsupported (listed above) platform.

		The following table lists the build system requirements of the smash project. 
		We will cover the smash-software-run-time-requiem after satisifcation of the 
		smash-software-build-time-requiems are known.</p>
	<p>The first field in the table is a reference to an external project by it's 
		official project name or official package name. Official project name is 
		preffered, followed by a 'generified' package-name within parenthesis.
		The second table field is the Dev. Version field, which refers to the current 
		version of the program being used on the machine of the smash-project-maintainer(s) during the time of the table-data-field-entry.</p>
	<p>Finally, the third table field is the notes field, which provides any extra information that may be beneficial knowledge about the external project.</p>
