:SHELL :FUNCTIONS

The shell supports the following shell scripting functions.

include(file)
 Compiles and executes the given Javascript.

exit(code)
  Exits smash immediately with the given exit code. Return 1 or more 
	to indicate error, return 0 to indicate success.

echo(...)
  Converts the parameters to string and prints them on the standard output.
	If the content does not end with a newline character, one will be appended.

echo.error(...)
  This function operates exactly like echo, but the content is written to
	standard error rather than standard output.

keys()
  Gets an array of all defined environment variable keys.

get(key)
  Gets a shell environment variable by key. 

set(key, value)
  Sets a shell environment variable's value by key.

clear(key)
  Deletes a shell environment variable by key.

getFileContent(file)
  Gets the content of a file as a String.

setFileContent(file, content)
  Sets the content of a file as a String. If the file does
	not exist, it will be created.

setFileContent.append(file, content)
  Works like setFileContent, but the file content provided will
	be appended to any existing file content.

system(command)
  Runs a system command and returns the status.

system.write(command, data)
  Runs a s system command and returns the status after writing
	the data to the command's standard input handle.

system.read(command)
  Runs a system command and returns an object with two properties:

	  1: (String) output
		2: (Double) status

	The status is the result of the command execution, and output
	is the output of the command.

readLine(prompt)
  Reads a line of input from the standard input. Prompt is printed on stderr.
